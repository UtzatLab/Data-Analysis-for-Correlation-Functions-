# Data-Analysis-for-Correlation-Functions-
The Photons code processes photon arrival time data between two detectors and provides various functions
the functions include:
  an intensity graph at each detector
  a fluorescence lifetime graph
  a log space correlation function 
  a pulse adapted log space correlation function
  
  The PCFS Code uses the functions provided in the photons code to do full PCFS analysis
